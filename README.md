# Sync With Hugging Face Spaces
This action creates seperate README.md file with a YAML header prepended for Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Space and syncs your updates with the space repo.

A repo using this action can be found [here](https://github.com/alex-bene/BianqueNet).

## Why replace README?
The README for the Hugging Face Spaces is required to have a YAML configuration head with details about the HF Space. However, this header is render in Github and does not look good. This action expects as input a seperate `.yml` file with the YAML configurations for the space and will automatically prepend it the README.md before pushing it to the HF Space.

## Usage example
```yaml
name: Sync with Hugging Face Space

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Sync with HF
      uses: alex-bene/huggingface-space-sync-action@v0.1
      with:
        # The github repo you are syncing from. Required.
        github_repo_id: ''
        # The branch of your github repo you want to sync from. Defaults to 'main'. Optional.
        github_branch: 'main'
        # The yaml headers file to use, e.g., hf_space_metadata.yml (will be prepended to your README.md in the HF space). Required.
        yaml_header_path: ''
        # The Hugging Face repo id you want to sync to. (ex. 'username/reponame'). Required.
        huggingface_repo_id: ''
        # Hugging Face token with write access and corresponding username. Required.
        # Here, we provide a token that we called `HF_TOKEN` when we added the secret to our GitHub repo.
        # Generate your HF_TOKEN from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
        hf_username: ''
